Project Description: 

The Advanced Calculator is a command-line application that performs a wide range of arithmetic operations with features like undo/redo, history tracking, automatic logging, and color outputs. 

Configuration Setup: 

In the project’s root directory, you can use the example .env from the github repository, and adjust as needy.

Usage Guide: 

The Advanced Calculator is a command-line application that performs a wide range of arithmetic operations with features like undo/redo, history tracking, and automatic logging. To start the calculator, activate your virtual environment, ensure all dependencies are installed, and run python -m app.calculator. This will launch the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface, where you can type commands interactively.

The calculator supports operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, root, modulus, int_divide, percent, and abs_diff. It also provides utility commands like history (view past calculations), undo and redo (revert or reapply actions), save and load (manage calculation history using CSV files), clear (reset history), and exit (quit the application). Errors such as invalid inputs or division by zero are handled gracefully, with clear messages to guide the user.

Configuration settings are managed via a .env file, allowing customization of directories, precision, and auto-save options. The application also implements observers for logging and auto-saving, ensuring that each calculation is recorded and saved automatically. Logging and history files are stored in the directories defined in the .env configuration.

All core functionalities are backed by comprehensive unit tests located in the tests/ directory. You can run tests with pytest --cov=app to verify correctness and ensure a minimum of 90% code coverage. Continuous Integration is handled through GitHub Actions (python-app.yml), which automatically installs dependencies, runs tests, and enforces the coverage threshold on every push or pull request.

Testing Instructions: 

You can download the application and run pytest, and the github actions runs the tests automatically too.

CI/CD Information: 

The primary purpose of github actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and pipeline. In your github repository, a yaml file defines how your github action runs testing for your configuration.

Usually your yaml file is located in .github/workflows directory. The yaml file runs automatically whenever code is pushed to or a pull request targets the master branch. It defines a single job called test that runs on the latest Ubuntu virtual environment. The workflow first checks out the repository’s code, then sets up Python 3.x on the runner. Next, it installs the project dependencies from requirements.txt and ensures that pytest and pytest-cov are available. Finally, it runs the test suite using pytest, measures code coverage for the app directory, and fails the job if the total coverage falls below 90%. Essentially, it provides automated testing with strict coverage enforcement for your Python project. 


# 📦 Project Setup

---

# 🧩 1. Install Homebrew (Mac Only)

> Skip this step if you're on Windows.

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS.  
You’ll use it to easily install Git, Python, Docker, etc.

**Install Homebrew:**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**Verify Homebrew:**

```bash
brew --version
```

If you see a version number, you're good to go.

---

# 🧩 2. Install and Configure Git

## Install Git

- **MacOS (using Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install git
```

- **Windows**

Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
Accept the default options during installation.

**Verify Git:**

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Configure Git Globals

Set your name and email so Git tracks your commits properly:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Confirm the settings:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## Generate SSH Keys and Connect to GitHub

> Only do this once per machine.

1. Generate a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

(Press Enter at all prompts.)

2. Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add the SSH private key to the agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

4. Copy your SSH public key:

- **Mac/Linux:**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
```

- **Windows (Git Bash):**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

5. Add the key to your GitHub account:
   - Go to [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
   - Click **New SSH Key**, paste the key, save.

6. Test the connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a success message.

---

# 🧩 3. Clone the Repository

Now you can safely clone the course project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

---

# 🛠️ 4. Install Python 3.10+

## Install Python

- **MacOS (Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install python
```

- **Windows**

Download and install [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
✅ Make sure you **check the box** `Add Python to PATH` during setup.

**Verify Python:**

```bash
python3 --version
```
or
```bash
python --version
```

---

## Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

(Optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
```

### Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 🐳 5. (Optional) Docker Setup

> Skip if Docker isn't used in this module.

## Install Docker

- [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

## Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

---

# 🚀 6. Running the Project

- **Without Docker**:

```bash
python main.py
```

(or update this if the main script is different.)

- **With Docker**:

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

---

# 📝 7. Submission Instructions

After finishing your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Module X"
